MolecularTransistor
====================

This is a web-app to illustrate the electrostatic gating of a single molecule by charged atoms deposited near it using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The molecule acts as a quantum dot in a single electron transistor that has a size of just one nanometer. The physics behind this can be found in:

Martínez-Blanco, J.; Nacci, C.; Erwin, S.C.; Kanisawa, K.; Locane, E.; Thomas, M.; von Oppen, F.; Brouwer, P.W. & Fölsch, S.
[Nature Physics (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys3385).

The subapplication for the calculation of the nanostructure electrostatic potential is taken from the app [Gating_with_adatoms](https://github.com/chumo/Gating_with_adatoms).

The interactivity has been implemented using the javascript visualization library [d3.js](http://d3js.org/).

You can try the web-app in the [project site](http://chumo.github.io/MolecularTransistor/).

### Awards
This web-app has been awarded with the **first prize** in the [IGK contest (2015)](http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/sfb/sfb658/IGK/index.html) of the publicly funded project (*Sonderforschungsbereich*) SFB-658.

### Libraries
Apart from [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), a copy of two javascript libraries are included and used, namely [PNGlib.js](http://www.xarg.org/2010/03/generate-client-side-png-files-using-javascript/) and [Bessel.JS](https://github.com/SheetJS/bessel). A guided tour through the app is also implemented, for which [jQuery.js](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap-tour.js](http://bootstraptour.com/) are used.


Enjoy!
